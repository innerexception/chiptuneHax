## Learning Phaser v3 with webpack and es6

### Roadmap:
- Better hacking animation (draw wires between tiles?)
- Add 2 more colors
- Add music with increasing speed
- Add mouseover animation to hacking tiles
- Enemy hacker, moves based on music beat
- Actual win/loss screens, tiles explode outwards to reveal win text and reset button

### Issues:
- Grids of different sizes not centered
