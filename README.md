Learning Phaser v3 with webpack and es6

Roadmap:
    -Better hacking animation (draw wires between tiles?)
    -Add 2 more colors
    -Add music with increasing speed
    -Add mouseover animation to hacking tiles
    -Add levels with more colors, different shaped grids
    -Enemy hacker, moves based on music beat
    -Actual win/loss screens, tiles explode outwards to reveal win text and reset button

Issues:
    -Adjacent tiles of matching color sometimes not highlighted
